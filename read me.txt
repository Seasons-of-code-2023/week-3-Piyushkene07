1.Given Fashion_Mnist dataset is first train with 50 epochs using simple autoencoder.
2.Its architecture contain two linear layer with relu activation function.
3.sigmoid activation function is use at last in decoder as input data is in range[0,1].
4.After that same dataset is train with 50 epochs using variational autoencoder.
5.Image reconstruction using autoencoder works well as compared to variational autoencoder for this network architecture.

Result :

Following output is provided in output folder :

1.Autoencoder reconstruction images result for epoch : 1,13,26,50 
  and corresponding MSE_loss for this epochs are 21.4344, 4.5376, 3.2576, 2.4810.
2.Autoencoder loss curve : Plot of MSE_loss Vs Epochs.
3.Variational Autoencoder reconstruction images result for epoch : 1,13,26,50 
  and corresponding loss (MSE + KLD) for this epochs are 36.5665, 26.5147, 25.8542, 25.3647.
4.Variational Autoencoder loss curve : Plot of loss (MSE + KLD) Vs Epochs.
